# Landing Page Challenge

#### Personal webpage, June 3rd, 2016
(previous version May 27th, 2016)

#### By Wolfgang Warneke

## Description

This project is an example of something that could serve as a home page for a personal portfolio web-site.  The portfolio is displayed via a Bootstrap carousel.

Future updates to this project may include a lightbox style pop-up to get a closer view of the portfolio screenshots and smoother version of the carousel. It is likely that the carousel is unnecessary for the responsive display for the smallest devices and could benefit from each project's content all being displayed vertically, rather than employing cramped horizontal swiping. On some small devices the responsiveness is lacking and could benefit from setting different breakpoints in Bootstrap.

It is possible that I will use this as a template for a full multi-subject personal website, which would necessitate the addition of a navigation element of some sort.
